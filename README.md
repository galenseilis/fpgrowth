## Installation and Compilation Instructions

Provided that you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system, you should not require taking any steps to install software for running `fpgrowth.py` because they are all implemented with [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) modules. Since Python is an [interpreted language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreted_language), and for your convenience I have intentionally **not** made use of any [Cython](https://cython.org/) or other extensions, you should be able to run the scripts immediately without any setup. If you do not have a sufficient version of Python installed, you can find downloads for it for any of the major operating systems on the main [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Execution

The script intended to be used from a command with `python3` available in your shell's namespace. All three of these scripts have a `-h` or `--help` option where you can see the available options. Also note that `-m`, representing the minimum (relative) support threshold, has a default value of 0.5, and that the default output file specified by `-o` is `"MiningResults.txt"`.

### apriori.py
```
usage: fpgrowth.py [-h] -i IN_FILE [-o OUT_FILE] [-m MIN_SUPP]

A CLI that performs the FP-Growth pattern learning algorithm. This program
expects an input text file with a particular format. The first line of the
input file should be the number of transactions in the transaction database.
All subsequent lines are expected to have a tab-delimited format where the
first column is the transaction ID, the second column is the number of items
in the transaction, and the third column is a space-delimited set of items.
Failure to format the input file correctly may result in errors or unexpected
behaviour.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUT_FILE, --out_file OUT_FILE
                        Output results file. (default='MiningResults.txt')
  -m MIN_SUPP, --min_supp MIN_SUPP
                        Minimum support threshold as a float between 0 and 1.
                        (default=0.5)

required arguments:
  -i IN_FILE, --in_file IN_FILE
                        Input data file.
```

> **_Example:_**  `python3 fpgrowth.py -i data.txt`

> **_Example:_**  `python3 fpgrowth.py -i data.txt -m 0.5 -o frequent_patterns_data.txt`

## Profiling

You may wish to further understand my code by profiling it to assess which pieces of the code are the performance bottlenecks. This can be accomplished with the [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/profile.html) from the command line, and no further installation is required since this library is built-in. The following shows the basic usage.

```
$ python3 -m cProfile -h
Usage: cProfile.py [-o output_file_path] [-s sort] [-m module | scriptfile] [arg] ...

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile=OUTFILE
                        Save stats to <outfile>
  -s SORT, --sort=SORT  Sort order when printing to stdout, based on
                        pstats.Stats class
  -m                    Profile a library module
```

> **_Example:_** `python3 -m cProfile -o data.prof fpgrowth.py -i data.txt`

Furthermore, you can easily visualize the output data with an extended library known as [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/), which can be installed with `pip install snakeviz`. This library can act as a command line tool, and I've included the usage below.

```
$ snakeviz -h
usage: snakeviz [-h] [-v] [-H ADDR] [-p PORT] [-b BROWSER_PATH] [-s] filename

Start SnakeViz to view a Python profile.

positional arguments:
  filename              Python profile to view

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -H ADDR, --hostname ADDR
                        hostname to bind to (default: 127.0.0.1)
  -p PORT, --port PORT  port to bind to; if this port is already in use a free
                        port will be selected automatically (default: 8080)
  -b BROWSER_PATH, --browser BROWSER_PATH
                        name of webbrowser to launch as described in the
                        documentation of Python's webbrowser module:
                        https://docs.python.org/3/library/webbrowser.html
  -s, --server          start SnakeViz in server-only mode--no attempt will be
                        made to open a browser
```

Once you have a `*.prof` file, you can easily visualize the results within a browser.

> **_Example:_** `snakeviz data.prof`
